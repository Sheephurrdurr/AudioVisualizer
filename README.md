# AudioVisualizer
**Vibe Coded with ChatGPT4 -& 5** and also 
**make sure the audio files exist in the Assets/ folder or the player will silently fail**

- C# WPF project that visualizes audio playback in real time.
- Supports multiple visualizers (Amplitude & FFT) and lets you toggle between them dynamically.
- Uses NAudio for audio playback and analysis, and WPF Canvas for rendering visuals.

Features
- Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous track functionality
- Visualize audio amplitude in real-time
- Visualize FFT (frequency spectrum) in real-time
- Toggle between visualizer types on the fly
- Playlist support with multiple audio files
- Smooth bar animations and decay for better visual effect

How it works:
1. Open the project in Visual Studio

2. Ensure audio files are in Assets/ folder

3. Build and run the project

4. Use the buttons:
  ▶ / ⏸ : Play / Pause
  ⏮ : Previous track
  ⏭ : Next track
  (At the moment you have to press the Play button, followed by the Next button. Consequences of vibe coding)
  
- Toggle Visualizer : Switch between Amplitude and FFT
